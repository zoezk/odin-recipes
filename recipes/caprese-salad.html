      <h2>What Is Caprese Salad?</h2>
      <p>
        Caprese is an Italian salad that consists of sliced tomatoes, sliced
        mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and balsamic reduction. The colorful
        dish is named after the island where it is said to have originated:
        Capri.

            simmer until mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Set
