    <h2>What Is a Sloppy Joe?</h2>
    <p>
      A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a
      tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According
      to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.
