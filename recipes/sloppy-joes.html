      <h2>What Is a Sloppy Joe?</h2>
      <p>
        A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a
        tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s.
        According to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a
        cook named Joe.
